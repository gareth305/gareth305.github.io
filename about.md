Hi!

I'm Gaz! - [@_GarethP](https://twitter.com/_GarethP){:target="\_blank"}

Initially, the plan was to solely use this as a automotive security blog (hence the name). However, times have changed and I'll be posting anything security. More as something for myself to refer to in the future, but also for others to use.

A little about me... I graduated from Leeds Beckett back in 2019 having studied computer forensics and security. In the past I've experienced computer repairs to database administration. However, currently, I'm a CySOC analyst focusing on automation and SIEM platforms.
